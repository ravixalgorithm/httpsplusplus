# HTTPS++ Architecture

## Overview
HTTPS++ aims to provide:
- Encrypted + anonymized web traffic through relay nodes
- Transparent certificate verification against a public ledger

## Components
1️⃣ **Browser extension**
2️⃣ **Relay network**
3️⃣ **Public cert ledger (mock)**

## Flow
Browser → Entry relay → (Middle relays) → Target → Cert validated → Response

## Future plans
- Multi-relay chaining
- Blockchain-backed ledger
- Onion routing layers
